### Outline

    1. We want to know where species are  
    2. We can do that using our computers: you can find them from home!  
    3. Understand species requirements  
    4. How computers learn about species requirements  
    5. Our results  
    6. Take home message (we can find species using computers YAY)  


### Main text
Have you ever noticed how when we travel to a place far away, we stop seeing animals we usually see back home?  
Or when that biologist on TV goes to a place that is really far from where you live, she shows a lot of birds, mammals and plants you have never seen before?  
And how do we know where we can find those animals and plants?  
We could try to explore every corner on Earth and list all living things that are present in each spot; scientists used to understand nature doing things like that, but that was a tremendous work.  
But it turns out that ecologists can now use computers to answer these questions without having to leave their labs!  

Imagine we want to know how far we should go to find a racoon, but we first need to know a little bit about them, like where they live and what they like to eat.  
So you look them up and find a couple of information:  
Their mating season happens around January and lasts approximately 63 days, after which the female gives birth to her offspring (4-6 cubs). Then, when you see groups of racoons,
it sure is a family taking a walk. At 10 months old, the baby racoons will be independent and will preffer to do thigs at their own way, hunting their own food and choosing a new place to live. 

Racoons are also great explorers! They are capable of running up to 15 miles per hour and of swimming, if necessary to find the perfect place to live. But, how raccoons choose their den?. Biologists discovered that raccoons usually select a wooded area near to a water source, but any quiet place with food and water can be a den. And what about the dinner?, Their front legs are very sensitive, which is a very useful tool to discover what is on the menu when you have an **omnivorous** diet, which means they eat plants, insects, frogs, eggs and rodents (such as rats). With such a varied diet and without a near forest with trees to climb and water to drink, they can take advantage of us, humans, by stealing our food and can thus live comfortably next to us during the next 10 years of their life expectancy.  

Now imagine that there are biologists around the world communicating this information, it is a large amount of data!, here is when we need that computers help us to analyze the data and find the species. When we ask computers to help us find them, we have to provide them with some information, such as those we just described.  

We could also use the kind of climate the racoons we already found typically prefer, or even the known distribution of what racoons need to eat.  
It might also be useful to know how long and where they can walk (Can they climb really high mountains? Can they cross rivers? What if there’s a completely different environment in the way, can they go through it?).  
Doing so, computers can start learning about racoons and their distribution.

Once a computer has learned all about what we told it, it will think for a while.  
But how do computers think?  
They use something we call algorithm, which is a sequence of orders it follows to reach an answer.  
For example, when we have to go outside, we have to decide what we should wear.  
So we gather some information, such as which clean clothes are available and if it’s raining or not.  
The following step would be to exclude options based on these information, using a sequence of statements: if it’s raining, we'll wear a jacket and boots; if it’s not raining, we’ll wear a t-shirt.  
If it’s raining, but the jacket is not clean… Well, you can either use a dirty jacket or stay home!

[labyrinth game]
> We'll draw a labyrinth and a couple of instructions. Kids have to follow the instructions to find the right path in the labyrinth.

Let's find together a raccoon! Here are some tips that would help you to find it. First, remember the thigs that they usually love, like garbage. Remember you cant jump over the garbage, you have to pass by a side. Now, we must search a place with a tree were raccoons love to climb or a source or water. Once you reach until a tree, you are really close to a raccoon. Good luck to find it!  (Please, when you find it, don’t touch it. They love to have privacy)  

Computers can apply the same logic to our racoons problem: if it’s too cold and snowy, or too hot and dry, racoons will probably not be there.  
If there’s no food they can eat, they will probably not be there either.  
On the contrary, if there is a temperate forest, where the temperature is neither too cold nor too hot, and if there is enough clean water for them to drink, they might be present, hidden somewhere in the woods.  
They might also be present if there is a city or a village with lots of food for them to eat.  
Who wouldn't be attracted to this trash buffet?

Computers help us see life from the animal’s perspective.  
What would be the most reasonable choice for a raccoon's everyday problems, like where to find food, water or a potential partner to have offspring with?  
The world is changing and racoons will constantly be moving and adapting to new places; having a common language with computers allow us to organize, to quantify and to understand what would be an ideal place to find a racoon now or in a near future.

Computers give us different kinds of numbers (like probabilities).  
According to the information we provided, they will calculate an unique number, between 0 and 1, for every place in the world.  
If this number is low, you might not be able to find a raccoon there.  
However, if this number is high, a raccoon might be hiding there somewhere.  
What's great with computers is that we can use these numbers to make beautiful maps!

We made one such map using three types of information: the  precise location where some raccoons have been observed in the past, the temperatures, and the total precipitations that were recorded at these locations.  
Our computer learned the suitable habitat for a raccoon, in terms of temperature and precipitation.  
Regions with a similar climate were given a high value and regions with an unsuitable climate were given a low value.  
Remember that regions with a high value, near 1, might contain a raccoon and that regions with a low value, near 0, might not contain any.  
Locate where you live in the world and see if it would be easy for you to find a racoon there!  
Help us validate our model by verifying if there is indeed a racoon where we said there might be!  
Does the map say there might be a racoon near your house but there’s no way to find a racoon there?  
In your opinion, how could we have made the map more realistic?
