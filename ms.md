Outline:
1. Species are not everywhere: why? (focus on one specific species)
1.2 How can we find them without having to look everywhere?
2.What kind of questions we can ask computers
2. 1 What kind of information we give to computers
3. How computers "think"
4. What kind of answers computers give and how we can use them
5. Interpret the map and invite for action - how far you have to go to see a "racoon"?

    Have you ever noticed how, when we travel to a place far away, we stop seeing animals we usually see back home? Or when that biologist on TV goes to a place that is really far from where you live, she shows a lot of birds, mammals and plants you have never seen before? And how do we know where we can find those animals and plants? We could try to go to every place on Earth and list all living things that live in each spot. That would be a tremendous work, and actually scientists started to understand nature doing things like that. But turns out that now ecologists can use computers to answer these questions without having to leave their labs.
Imagine we want to know how far we should go to find a racoon. We know some facts about them, like the mating season: it happens around January and lasts approximately 63 days, when the female gives birth to her offspring (4-6 cubs), who once have 10 months will be independent and will hunt their own food and find a place to live. At the time to eat, their front legs are very sensitive, which is very useful tool for discover what is the menu when you have an omnivorous diet made up of plants, fruits, or small animals and insects. With such a varied diet,  are capable to adapt close to humans and live easily comfortable during the next 10 years of life expectancy. Racoons are solitary, but if you see a group it surely be a protective mother and their young. Are capable to run up to 15 miles per hour or swim if necessary. Prefered home for a raccoon usually are wooded areas near to water, but any quiet place near to food and water can be a den. 
 [describe racoons, how they live and fun things about them]. To ask computers to help us find them, we should provide some information, such as those we just described, but also what kind of climate the racoons we already found like the most, what racoons need to eat, or how long they can walk (can they climb really high mountains? can they cross rivers? what if there’s a completely different environment on the way, can they go through it?). That way, the computer can learn about racoons.
    Once computer have learned all about what we told them, it will think a while. But how do computers think? They use something we call algorithm, which is a sequence of orders it follows to reach an answer. For example, when we have to go out, we have to decide what we should wear. So we gather some information, such as what are the clean clothes available and if it’s raining or not. The following step would be to exclude options based on these informations, and we use a sequence of statements: if it’s raining, we’ll wear a jacket and boots; if it’s not raining, we’ll wear a t-shirt. If it’s raining, but the jacket is not clean… Well, you can either use a dirty jacket or stay home!
[labyrinth game]
    Computers can apply this same logic to our racoons problem: if it’s too cold and snowy, racoons will probably not be there. If there’s no trash, they will probably not be there either. [IT’S JUST A DRAFT and I’m not familiar with racoons!!!! Do they fly? IDK] 
Computers will help us to see life from the animal’s point of view, what would be the most reasonable choice for daily racoon problems,  like where to find food, water or a potential partner to have offspring. The world is changing and racoons will be constantly moving and adapting to new places; having a common language with computers allow us organize, quantify and understand what will be an ideal place to find a racoon. 
Computers give us different kinds of numbers (like probabilities)
We can use these numbers to make maps!
Last paragraph: The Map!
Interpretation of the suitability gradient
Locate where you live and see if it’s easy to find a racoon there!
Model validation: help us see if there’s a racoon where we said there is! / does the map says there is a racoon near your house but there’s no way to find a racoon there?
