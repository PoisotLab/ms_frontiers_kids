If we want to protect our environment, we first need to know where animals and plants are. Are they hidden in the woods? Are they next to cities? Which woods or which cities? Wandering all over the world to find where living things are might seem exciting at first. However, in the long run, it might get a little tiring, no? Thankfully, we do not need to explore every inch and corner of the earth to know where they are. Scientists instead use computers to deduce where they might be. Here we show how to find where raccoons are by using special recipes read by computers. To do so, we just need a few observations of racoons, the environmental conditions in which they have been identified, and a set of instructions to give to our computer.
