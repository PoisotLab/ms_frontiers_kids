## Authors mini bio

### Francis Banville

Francis is a PhD candidate in biology at the University of Montreal. His research focuses on the many interactions between species all over the world. More precisely, he uses mathematical and computational tools to predict how species interact in a given environment. In his free time he enjoys playing board games and running in the snowy streets of Montreal.

### Gracielle
Gracielle is a Phd candidate in ecology and evolution. She makes fake species and sees how they get along in a fake environment, so she can understand how the real world works. She loves reading, spending time in parks and playing with the videogame she assembled herself using a RaspberryPi.

### Norma
Norma is a PhD student in Biology at Universite de Montreal. His work focuses on understanding the behavior of diseases between animals and people, considering the the places where they live and how they are related, using computers to analyze all this information.

### Gabriel Dansereau

Gabriel is an M.Sc student in biology at the University of Montreal. His research interests are species distributions (where species are found) and biodiversity hotspots (exceptional places where you can find either many species, few species, rare species, or unusual species combinations).

### Timothée Poisot
Timothée Poisot is a computational ecologist interested in solving ecological questions using tools from data science, applied mathematics, and machine learning; his research focuses on understanding and predicting interactions between species.
