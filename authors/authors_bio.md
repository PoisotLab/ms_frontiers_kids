## Authors mini bio

### Francis Banville

Francis is a PhD student in biology at the University of Montreal. His research focuses on the prediction of food-web structure (i.e. who eats who in a community of several species). He uses computers a lot to conduct his simulations.

### Gracielle
Gracielle is an ecologist trying to understand how the world works by making fake species in a fake environment, but also by translating parts of nature into numbers. Her dreams are to understand why species are distributed the way we see them today and to be fluent in French. She loves reading, spending time in parks and playing with the videogame she assembled herself using a RaspberryPi.

### Norma
Norma is a PhD student in Biology at Universite de Montreal. His work focuses on understanding the behavior of diseases between animals and people, considering the the places where they live and how they are related, using computers to analyze all this information.

### Gabriel Dansereau

Gabriel is an M.Sc student in biology at the University of Montreal. His research interests are species distributions (where species are found) and biodiversity hotspots (exceptional places where you can find either many species, few species, rare species, or unusual species combinations).

### Timothée Poisot
Timothée Poisot is a computational ecologist interested in solving ecological questions using tools from data science, applied mathematics, and machine learning; his research focuses on understanding and predicting interactions between species.
